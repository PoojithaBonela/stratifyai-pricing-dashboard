# Stratify AI — Dynamic Pricing Dashboard

A responsive single-page pricing dashboard. The project is themed around a fictional AI SaaS product and focuses on dynamic, data-driven UI architecture built with React.

---

## How Requirements Were Satisfied

### Data Requirements

- All pricing data is stored externally in `public/pricingData.json`
- Data is fetched at runtime using `useEffect` and the native `fetch()` API
- No pricing values, plan names, feature lists, or limits are hardcoded in JSX
- The UI re-renders automatically whenever the JSON data changes

### Dynamic Rendering

- Pricing cards are generated by mapping over the `plans` array fetched from JSON
- The billing toggle (monthly / yearly) updates displayed prices via React state
- Currency conversion (INR / USD / EUR) is handled dynamically in `currencyFormatter.js`
- The "Recommended" plan badge is controlled by a `"recommended": true` flag in the JSON

The UI is fully data-driven. Any plan, price, or feature can be updated from the JSON without modifying any component code.

---

## Dynamic Pricing & Comparison Table

- Pricing cards are generated by mapping over the fetched `plans` array
- Feature groups are structured as nested arrays within each plan object in JSON
- The comparison table (`ComparisonTable.jsx`) fetches `comparisonData.json` separately and renders all sections dynamically
- Plan-specific limits (e.g. simulation runs, scenario comparisons) use `{{placeholder}}` tokens in `comparisonData.json`, which are resolved at runtime against values from `pricingData.json`
- Toggle and currency selector updates propagate through state without page reloads

**Separation of concerns:**

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| JSON files | Data source |
| React components | Presentation and logic |

## Component Architecture

```
public/
  pricingData.json         # Plan data, prices, features, limits
  comparisonData.json      # Comparison table sections and feature rows

src/
  components/
    layout/
      Navbar.jsx
      MobileMenu.jsx
      Footer.jsx
    marketing/
      Hero.jsx
      Metrics.jsx
      TrustedBy.jsx
      FeaturesSection.jsx
      CTABanner.jsx
    pricing/
      PricingSection.jsx   # Top-level pricing state manager
      PricingCard.jsx      # Reusable plan card component
      BillingToggle.jsx
      CurrencySelector.jsx
      ComparisonTable.jsx
      FAQSection.jsx
  pages/
    Home.jsx
  utils/
    currencyFormatter.js
  hooks/
    usePricing.js
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
```

- Components are reusable and scoped to a single responsibility
- Data flows from parent (`PricingSection`) to children (`PricingCard`) via props
- State is managed at the appropriate level — billing and currency state lives in `usePricing.js`

Every page follows the layout: **Navbar → Main Content Sections → Footer**

---

## Styling & UI

- Built with **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Consistent spacing and typographic scale throughout
- Subtle ambient gradient effects using layered `blur` and `opacity` utilities
- Hover animations on pricing cards (lift, shadow, scale)
- Scroll-based fade-in transitions using `IntersectionObserver`
- Price change transitions on toggle to provide visual feedback
- Dark-themed metrics section with white-inverted logo assets

---

## Responsive Design

- Mobile-first layout using Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)
- Pricing cards stack vertically on mobile, display in a 3-column grid on desktop
- Comparison table adapts to a stacked card layout on smaller screens
- Mobile navigation uses a slide-in drawer with accordion submenu expansion
- Footer reorganizes into a single-column layout on mobile

The UI is tested across desktop and mobile viewport widths.

## Key Frontend Concepts Demonstrated

- Dynamic data rendering from external JSON
- State management with React hooks
- Conditional rendering
- JSON-driven UI architecture
- Separation of data and presentation
- Reusable component design
- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- Intersection Observer for scroll effects

## Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Summary

This project demonstrates frontend engineering principles including scalable UI architecture, JSON-driven dynamic rendering, and clean responsive design — as commonly required in modern SaaS frontend development.
